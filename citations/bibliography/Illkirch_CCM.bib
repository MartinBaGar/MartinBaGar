  abstract = {ABSTRACT                              Small-molecule CCR5 inhibitors such as vicriviroc (VVC) and maraviroc (MVC) are allosteric modulators that impair HIV-1 entry by stabilizing a CCR5 conformation that the virus recognizes inefficiently. Viruses resistant to these compounds are able to bind the inhibitor-CCR5 complex while also interacting with the free coreceptor. CCR5 also interacts intracellularly with G proteins, as part of its signal transduction functions, and this process alters its conformation. Here we investigated whether the action of VVC against inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant viruses is affected by whether or not CCR5 is coupled to G proteins such as G{$\alpha$}                i                . Treating CD4                +                T cells with pertussis toxin to uncouple the G{$\alpha$}                i                subunit from CCR5 increased the potency of VVC against the sensitive viruses and revealed that VVC-resistant viruses use the inhibitor-bound form of G{$\alpha$}                i                -coupled CCR5 more efficiently than they use uncoupled CCR5. Supportive evidence was obtained by expressing a signaling-deficient CCR5 mutant with an impaired ability to bind to G proteins, as well as two constitutively active mutants that activate G proteins in the absence of external stimuli. The implication of these various studies is that the association of intracellular domains of CCR5 with the signaling machinery affects the conformation of the external and transmembrane domains and how they interact with small-molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 entry.},

  abstract = {CCR5 acts as the principal coreceptor during HIV-1 transmission and early stages of infection. Efficient HIV-1 entry requires a series of processes, many dependent on the conformational state of both viral envelope protein and cellular receptor. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are able to identify different CCR5 conformations, allowing for their use as probes to distinguish CCR5 populations. Not all CCR5 MAbs are able to reduce HIV-1 infection, suggesting the use of select CCR5 populations for entry. In the U87.CD4.CCR5-GFP cell line, we used such HIV-1-restricting MAbs to probe the relation between localization, trafficking and G protein association for individual CCR5 conformations. We find that CCR5 conformations not only exhibit different localization and abundance patterns throughout the cell, but that they also display distinct sensitivities to endocytosis inhibition. Using chemokine analogs that vary in their HIV-1 inhibitory mechanisms, we also illustrate that responses to ligand engagement are conformation-specific. Additionally, we provide supporting evidence for the select sensitivity of conformations to G protein association. Characterizing the link between the function and dynamics of CCR5 populations has implications for understanding their selective targeting by HIV-1 and for the development of inhibitors that will block CCR5 utilization by the virus.},

  abstract = {The chemokine receptor CCR5 is a key player in HIV-1 infection. The cryo-EM 3D structure of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) subunit gp120 in complex with CD4 and CCR5 has provided important structural insights into HIV-1/host cell interaction, yet it has not explained the signaling properties of Env nor the fact that CCR5 exists in distinct forms that show distinct Env binding properties. We used classical molecular dynamics and site-directed mutagenesis to characterize the CCR5 conformations stabilized by four gp120s, from laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains, and which were previously shown to bind differentially to distinct CCR5 forms and to exhibit distinct cellular tropisms. The comparative analysis of the simulated structures reveals that the different gp120s do indeed stabilize CCR5 in different conformational ensembles. They differentially reorient extracellular loops 2 and 3 of CCR5 and thus accessibility to the transmembrane binding cavity. They also reshape this cavity differently and give rise to different positions of intracellular ends of transmembrane helices 5, 6 and 7 of the receptor and of its third intracellular loop, which may in turn influence the G protein binding region differently. These results suggest that the binding of gp120s to CCR5 may have different functional outcomes, which could result in different properties for viruses.},

  abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the largest and most diverse groups of proteins in the genome. Activated receptors catalyse nucleotide exchange on a relatively small group of heterotrimeric G proteins to initiate intracellular signalling.Biophysical studies of rhodopsin-family GPCRs have shown that receptor activation results in an outward movement of transmembrane helix VI, which opens a pocket for G protein binding. Increasing evidence suggests that the structure, conformation and specificity of the G protein binding site can be regulated by the identity of the bound ligand.Several different models for receptor\textendash G-protein association have been proposed. These proteins may be precoupled in a large signalling complex. Nucleotide exchange may follow a series of transition complexes. Receptors may function as dimers to activate G proteins.Biophysical studies indicate that receptor-mediated GDP release requires a conformational change in the {$\alpha$}5 helix of the G{$\alpha$} subunit and is associated with structural changes at the G{$\beta$} binding site. However, additional studies are required to fully describe the mechanism of receptor-mediated GDP release and the structure of the receptor\textendash G-protein complex.Binding of GTP induces a structural rearrangement of the receptor\textendash G-protein complex that leads to dissociation of some, but not all, complexes. This observation is consistent with the existence of precoupled receptor\textendash G-protein complexes that may not completely disassemble on G protein activation.Fundamentally, the unanswered questions about G protein activation reflect a poor understanding of the structure of the complex. A goal of future studies will be to refine current models of the receptor\textendash G-protein complex in terms of the available structural information until a crystal structure of the complex is solved.},

  abstract = {The heterotrimeric G protein family plays essential roles during a varied array of cellular events; thus, its deregulation can seriously alter signaling events and the overall state of the cell. Heterotrimeric G-proteins have three subunits ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, {$\gamma$}) and are subdivided into four families, G{$\alpha$}i, G{$\alpha$}12/13, G{$\alpha$}q, and G{$\alpha$}s. These proteins cycle between an inactive G{$\alpha$}-GDP state and active G{$\alpha$}-GTP state, triggered canonically by the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and by other accessory proteins receptors independent also known as AGS (Activators of G-protein Signaling). In this review, we summarize research data specific for the G{$\alpha$}i family. This family has the largest number of individual members, including G{$\alpha$}i1, G{$\alpha$}i2, G{$\alpha$}i3, G{$\alpha$}o, G{$\alpha$}t, G{$\alpha$}g, and G{$\alpha$}z, and constitutes the majority of G proteins {$\alpha$} subunits expressed in a tissue or cell. G{$\alpha$}i was initially described by its inhibitory function on adenylyl cyclase activity, decreasing cAMP levels. Interestingly, today Gi family G-protein have been reported to be importantly involved in the immune system function. Here, we discuss the impact of G{$\alpha$}i on non-canonical effector proteins, such as c-Src, ERK1/2, phospholipase-C (PLC), and proteins from the Rho GTPase family members, all of them essential signaling pathways regulating a wide range of physiological processes.},
